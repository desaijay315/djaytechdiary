## Creating Security Groups in AWS

In this article, we will be creating a security group in AWS which will be helpful for all our DevOps deployments pipeline.

### Security Groups

AWS Security Groups act as a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance on Amazon EC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.

After that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers over the internet. You can create a security group that you want for your specific applications and it's quite flexible.

Now, let us go ahead and create a security group:

- In your AWS, Go to the services -> EC2 -> Security Group.
- Click on create a security group
